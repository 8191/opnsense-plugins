This plugin allows synchronizing firewall aliases over several OPNsense instances.

Typically one master instance is designated, which is the only instance where
alias records are maintained. The master instance then synchronizes the
records to all other configured OPNsense instances.

Synchronization is done via the OPNsense Core API. This plugin is only required
on the master instance.
