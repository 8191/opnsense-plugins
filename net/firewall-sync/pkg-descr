This plugin allows synchronizing firewall aliases and rules over several
OPNsense instances.

Typically one master instance is designated, which is the only instance where
alias and rule records are maintained. The master instance then synchronizes the
records to all other configured OPNsense instances.

Alias synchronization is done via the OPNsense Core API, while rule synchronization
requires the `firewall` module. This plugin is only required on the master instance.
The firewall module is required on each target.
